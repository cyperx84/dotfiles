# Sesh Configuration
# Managed via GNU Stow - symlinked to ~/.config/sesh/sesh.toml
#
# Platform Support: macOS, Linux (Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian)
# - Paths using ~ will expand correctly on all platforms
# - Platform-specific system paths are handled by scripts (sesh_common.sh)
# - This blacklist supplements script-level filtering

# Blacklist sessions from appearing in sesh list
# Filter out system directories, cache, junk paths, and development artifacts
# Note: macOS-specific paths (/Users, /Library) won't match on Linux (harmless)
